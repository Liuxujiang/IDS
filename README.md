# An trustworthy intrusion detection framework enabled by ex-post-interpretation-enabled approach (TIDF)
*TIDF is accepted by Journal of Information Security and Applications. Our is code publicly available.*
## Background  
An enormous number of machine learning models have been recently proposed for intrusion detection. Among these models, the complex models stand out as a prominent approach for intrusion detection in network security. In contrast with the simple models, the complex models are powerful in that it learns the complex abstraction between input and output under the premise of the loss of the transparency. This lack of interpretability hinders the landing of the complex model in the field of intrusion detection.


In the mean while, in order to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our experiments, we recorded the code running process and put it on the Google Cloud, here is the link "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ypJB6a0K-gRHHR1Q0An9ItreU-5lnBka?usp=share_link".
